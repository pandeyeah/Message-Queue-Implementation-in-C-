Title: Message Queue Implementation in C++ for Asynchronous Communication

Description:

1. Designed and Implemented a Message Queue System in C++: Developed a message queue system to facilitate asynchronous communication between producers and consumers, utilizing concepts like FIFO order, synchronization, and mutual exclusion using mutex and condition variables.

2. Built Efficient Producer-Consumer Model: Created producer and consumer threads that interact with the message queue, ensuring smooth message delivery and processing. Utilized multithreading to enable parallel operations in a distributed system-like environment.

3. Enhanced System Flexibility and Reliability: Implemented the core functionality of enqueueing and dequeueing messages with mechanisms for thread safety, and message handling, allowing for scalable and robust communication across different system components.
